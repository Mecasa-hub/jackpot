# Getting Started

## Welcome to JACPOT! 🎰

This guide walks you through everything you need to start participating in the JACPOT ecosystem — from buying your first tokens to entering your first daily draw.

---

## Step 1: Set Up Your Wallet

### Requirements
- A Web3 wallet (MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, or any WalletConnect-compatible wallet)
- Connected to the **Base** network
- Some ETH on Base for gas fees
- USDC on Base for purchasing raffle tickets

### Adding Base Network
If Base isn't already in your wallet:

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Network Name | Base |
| RPC URL | https://mainnet.base.org |
| Chain ID | 8453 |
| Currency Symbol | ETH |
| Block Explorer | https://basescan.org |

---

## Step 2: Buy JACPOT Tokens

1. Visit the JACPOT DApp or your preferred Base DEX
2. Swap ETH or USDC for JACPOT tokens
3. Note: A **5% buy tax** is applied — 4% goes to the **Jackpot Pot** and 1% goes to the **Team**

> 💡 **Tip:** The buy tax funds the jackpot that you could win. Think of it as your contribution to the prize pool.

---

## Step 3: Stake Your Tokens

Staking is where the magic happens. Your staked tokens earn **Luck** — a score that multiplies your odds in every draw.

1. Navigate to the **Staking** section in the DApp
2. Choose the amount of JACPOT tokens to stake
3. Confirm the transaction
4. Your Luck Score begins accumulating immediately

### What You Get From Staking

| Benefit | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 🍀 **Luck Score** | Accumulates over time, multiplies your raffle odds |
| 🗡️ **Daily Missions** | Unlocks daily tasks that earn Luck Shards |
| 🎁 **Mystery Crates** | Daily claimable rewards with tiered rarity |
| 🏆 **Tier Progression** | Higher tiers unlock exclusive draws and better rewards |
| 💰 **USDC Rewards** | Share of ticket sales and treasury yield |

> ⚠️ **Important:** Unstaking triggers a **50% Luck Decay** penalty. Stake with a long-term mindset for the best results.

---

## Step 4: Buy Raffle Tickets

Raffle tickets are your entry into the daily draws.

1. Navigate to the **Raffle** section in the DApp
2. Choose the number of tickets to purchase (paid in USDC)
3. Confirm the transaction
4. You're automatically entered into today's draws

### Key Details
- Tickets are **valid for the current day only** — they expire at 00:00 UTC
- Each ticket's effective weight is multiplied by your **Luck Score**
- **Per-wallet daily caps** apply to prevent whale domination
- Ticket revenue goes to the **Treasury** (not the Jackpot Pot)

---

## Step 5: Engage Daily

Maximize your odds by completing daily activities:

### Daily Checklist

- [ ] 🎁 Claim your Mystery Crate
- [ ] 📊 Check the leaderboard
- [ ] 🎟️ Buy raffle tickets
- [ ] 🍀 Check your Luck Score
- [ ] 🔥 Maintain your streak

Completing all daily missions earns you **Luck Shards** that further boost your Luck Score. Consecutive daily engagement builds a **streak multiplier** — up to 3.0x at 90+ days.

---

## Step 6: Check the Draws

Every day, two types of draws occur:

### 🎁 Small Wins (25 Winners Daily)
- Guaranteed every day regardless of volume
- Winners selected via Chainlink VRF (Luck-weighted)
- **Must share on X (Twitter) to claim** — this drives organic growth
- Prizes distributed across 4 tiers (Top Prize, Runner Up, Lucky Pick, Micro Win)

### 🎰 Jackpot Draw (Conditional)
- Triggers when internal protocol parameters are met
- Funded by the 4% jackpot portion of the 5% buy/sell tax
- If no winner is drawn: 85% rolls over, 15% goes to stakers
- During Pressure Mode: pot grows until a forced Mega Draw at 14 days

---

## Your First Week Plan

| Day | Action | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Day 1 | Buy JACPOT + Stake + Buy first tickets | Start accumulating Luck immediately |
| Day 2 | Claim crate + Complete all missions | Begin your streak |
| Day 3–7 | Daily missions + Buy tickets | Build streak multiplier, grow Luck Score |
| Day 7+ | Maintain streak, never unstake | Your compounding advantage grows daily |

---

## Tips for New Users

1. **Stake early** — Luck accumulates over time; every day counts
2. **Never break your streak** — The streak multiplier is one of your biggest advantages
3. **Don't unstake** — The 50% Luck penalty is severe; think long-term
4. **Buy tickets daily** — Even 1 ticket per day keeps you in every draw
5. **Check the leaderboard** — See where you stand and what tier you're approaching
6. **Save Luck Shards strategically** — Decide between passive multiplier and spending on boosts
