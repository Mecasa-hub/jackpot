## Streak System

Your engagement streak is one of the most powerful mechanics in the ecosystem.

### How Streaks Work
- Log in and complete at least one mission per day to maintain your streak
- Each consecutive day increases your streak counter
- Streak multiplier applies to **all Luck Shard earnings**

### Streak Multiplier Table

| Streak Length | Shard Multiplier | Daily Shards (All Missions) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1–7 days | 1.0x | ~40 |
| 8–14 days | 1.25x | ~50 |
| 15–30 days | 1.5x | ~60 |
| 31–60 days | 2.0x | ~80 |
| 61–90 days | 2.5x | ~100 |
| 90+ days | 3.0x | ~120 |

### Streak Protection
- ⚠️ **Missing one day resets your streak to 0**
- 🛡️ **Streak Shield** — Spend 5,000 Luck Shards to protect your streak for 1 missed day
- Only one Streak Shield can be active at a time

> 💡 **Tip:** A 90-day streak earns you 3x the Luck Shards of a new user. This compounds your Luck Score advantage significantly over time.

| 501–2,000 | +5% |
| 2,001–10,000 | +10% |
| 10,001–50,000 | +15% |
| 50,001+ | +20% |

### Option B: Spend for Immediate Boosts

| Item | Cost | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |

| 🎁 Premium Crate | 2,500 Shards | Guaranteed Rare+ crate |
| 🛡️ Streak Shield | 5,000 Shards | Protects streak for 1 missed day |
