# Raffle Participation

## How Draws Work

### Before the Draw

1. **Buy Raffle Passes** — Choose your tier and quantity
2. **Ensure tokens are staked** — Your Luck Score multiplies your odds
3. **Maintain your streak** — Higher streak = higher Luck = better odds
4. **Check the snapshot deadline** — Passes must be purchased before the cutoff

### During the Draw

1. **Snapshot taken** — All valid passes and Luck Scores are recorded
2. **VRF requested** — Chainlink generates a provably fair random number
3. **Winner selected** — Weighted random selection based on passes × Luck
4. **Prize distributed** — USDC sent directly to winner's wallet
5. **Passes burned** — All entered passes are consumed

### After the Draw

1. **Check results** — Winner announced on dApp and social media
2. **Verify fairness** — Use the "Verify Draw" tool to check VRF proof
3. **Buy new passes** — For the next draw cycle
4. **Pot refills** — 35% rollover + new tax revenue starts the next pot
