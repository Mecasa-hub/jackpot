### 🎰 Tier 2: Jackpot Draw

The main event — a single winner takes a massive prize from the Jackpot Pot.

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Winners** | 1 (if triggered) |
| **Funding Source** | 4% of the 5% buy/sell tax (USDC) |
| **Selection Method** | Chainlink VRF (Luck-weighted) |
| **Trigger** | Internal protocol parameters met |

#### When the Jackpot Triggers (Winner Drawn)

| Allocation | Percentage | Destination |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🏆 **Winner** | 50% | Sent to winner's wallet |
| 🔄 **Rollover** | 35% | Stays in pot for next draw |
| 🔥 **LP Buyback/Burn** | 10% | Token buyback and liquidity |
| 🏦 **Treasury** | 5% | Operations and reserves |

#### When No Winner is Drawn

| Allocation | Percentage | Destination |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🔄 **Rollover** | 85% | Stays in pot (grows the jackpot) |
| 💰 **Staker Rewards** | 15% | Distributed to JACPOT stakers in USDC |

> 💡 **Key Insight:** Even when nobody wins the jackpot, stakers earn USDC rewards. And the pot grows bigger, making the next draw even more exciting.

## How Luck Affects Your Odds

Tickets are **not equal**. Your Luck Score multiplies the weight of every ticket you hold:

```
Effective Entries = Tickets × Luck Score
```

### Practical Example

Assume today's draw has 5 participants:

| Player | Tickets | Luck Score | Effective Entries | Win Chance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| You (3 months staked) | 3 | 5,000 | 15,000 | 48.4% |
| Whale (1 week staked) | 10 | 500 | 5,000 | 16.1% |
| Veteran (6 months) | 2 | 8,000 | 16,000 | 51.6% |
| Casual (no stake) | 5 | 100 | 500 | 1.6% |
| Newbie (2 days) | 3 | 150 | 450 | 1.5% |

> **Takeaway:** The whale bought 10 tickets but has worse odds than you with 3 tickets. Luck Staking is the real competitive advantage.

## Pressure Mode & Mega Draws

During low-volume periods, the protocol enters **Pressure Mode**:

1. Standard jackpot draws **pause** to let the pot accumulate
2. Trading taxes and treasury bonuses continue filling the pot
3. **Daily Small Wins continue** — 25 winners every day, no interruption
4. After **14 days**, a **forced Mega Draw** guarantees a jackpot winner

### Why This Is Good for You
- The pot grows larger during Pressure Mode
- Fewer participants = better individual odds
- Mega Draws create massive excitement and social buzz
- Your Luck Score keeps compounding while you wait

---
