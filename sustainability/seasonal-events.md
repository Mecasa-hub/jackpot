# Seasonal Events

## Overview

Seasonal Events are **limited-time campaigns** that inject fresh excitement into the JACPOT ecosystem. They provide bonus rewards, unique challenges, and special draw mechanics that drive engagement spikes and attract new users.

## Event Calendar Strategy

Events are strategically scheduled to maintain engagement throughout the year:

```
Q1: New Year's Mega Draw → Valentine's Luck → Spring Season
Q2: Easter Egg Hunt → Summer Kickoff → Competitive Season 1
Q3: Summer Jackpot → Back-to-School → Competitive Season 2
Q4: Halloween Crates → Black Friday Frenzy → Holiday Mega Draw
```

### Frequency Guidelines
- **Major Events:** 1 per quarter (1–2 weeks each)
- **Mini Events:** 1–2 per month (2–3 days each)
- **Competitive Seasons:** 2 per year (4 weeks each)
- **Gap between events:** Minimum 1 week of normal operations

> 💡 **Why gaps matter:** Constant events create fatigue. Strategic gaps make each event feel special and create anticipation.
