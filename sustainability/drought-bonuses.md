# Drought Bonuses

## Purpose

Drought Bonuses are **treasury-funded injections** into the Jackpot Pot during low-volume periods. They ensure the pot remains attractive and growing even when organic tax revenue from trading is minimal.

## How They Work

### Activation

Drought Bonuses activate automatically when **Pressure Mode** is active (trading volume below threshold for 3+ consecutive days).

### Bonus Tiers

| Drought Duration | Daily Bonus | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Days 1–3 | No bonus (monitoring period) | — |
| Days 4–7 | $500/day | Treasury yield allocation |
| Days 8–10 | $1,000/day | Treasury yield allocation |
| Days 11–14 | $2,500/day | Treasury yield + reserve |
| Day 14+ | Mega Draw forced | Full accumulated pot |

### Bonus Escalation Logic

The longer the drought, the more aggressive the treasury support:

```
Day 1-3:   Monitoring... no injection
           (Small Wins still run daily from ticket sales)

Day 4:     +$500  → Pot grows faster than organic tax alone
Day 5:     +$500  → Community notices pot acceleration
Day 6:     +$500  → "The pot is growing even without volume!"
Day 7:     +$500  → Social buzz increases

Day 8:     +$1,000 → Significant daily growth
Day 9:     +$1,000 → New users attracted by pot size
Day 10:    +$1,000 → Volume starting to recover?

Day 11:    +$2,500 → Aggressive push
Day 12:    +$2,500 → "Mega Draw in 2 days!"
Day 13:    +$2,500 → Maximum anticipation
Day 14:    MEGA DRAW TRIGGERED
```

### Total Drought Bonus (Full 14-Day Cycle)

If a full 14-day Pressure Mode cycle plays out:

| Period | Days | Daily Rate | Subtotal |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Monitoring | 3 | $0 | $0 |
| Tier 1 | 4 | $500 | $2,000 |
| Tier 2 | 3 | $1,000 | $3,000 |
| Tier 3 | 4 | $2,500 | $10,000 |
| **Total** | **14** | — | **$15,000** |

> The treasury contributes up to **$15,000 per drought cycle** to keep the pot attractive.

## What Keeps Running During a Drought

Drought Bonuses work alongside other systems that remain active:

| System | Status | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Daily Small Wins** | ✅ Active | 25 winners daily (from ticket sales), must share on X to claim |
| **Drought Bonuses** | ✅ Active | Treasury injects funds into pot |
| **Tax Revenue** | ✅ Active | Even minimal trading adds to pot |
| **Mystery Crates** | ✅ Active | Enhanced drop rates during drought |
| **Daily Missions** | ✅ Active | Bonus missions added |
| **Luck Staking** | ✅ Active | Enhanced Luck Shard earnings |
| **Jackpot Draw** | ❌ Paused | Pot accumulates for Mega Draw |

> **Small Wins are the engagement bridge** — even during a drought, 25 people win prizes every day and share on X, keeping the protocol visible and active.

## Sustainability

### Can the Treasury Afford This?

Drought Bonuses are funded by **treasury yield**, not principal:

| Treasury Size | Annual Yield (8%) | Monthly Yield | Max Drought Cost (14 days) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $50,000 | $4,000 | $333 | $15,000 (requires reserve dip) |
| $100,000 | $8,000 | $667 | $15,000 (requires reserve dip) |
| $250,000 | $20,000 | $1,667 | $15,000 (covered by yield) |
| $500,000 | $40,000 | $3,333 | $15,000 (easily covered) |

> At $250K+ treasury, drought bonuses are fully sustainable from yield alone. Below that, the treasury reserve buffer covers the gap.

### Safety Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **Maximum daily cap** | Prevents excessive treasury drain |
| **Reserve minimum** | Drought Bonuses pause if treasury reserve drops below threshold |
| **Governance override** | Diamond+ stakers can vote to adjust rates |
| **Automatic scaling** | Bonus rates scale with treasury size (larger treasury = larger bonuses) |

## Drought Bonus + Pressure Mode + Small Wins Synergy

The three systems work together to create a powerful narrative during low-volume periods:

```
Volume Drops → Pressure Mode Activates
    │
    ├── Small Wins continue daily
    │   └── 25 winners share on X every day
    │       └── Organic visibility maintained
    │
    ├── Drought Bonuses inject funds
    │   └── Pot grows faster than expected
    │       └── "The protocol is healthy!"
    │
    └── Pot accumulates (no jackpot payouts)
        └── Pot gets HUGE
            └── Attracts new users
                └── Volume recovers
                    └── MEGA DRAW → Viral moment
                        └── Cycle resets with more users
```

1. Volume drops → Pressure Mode activates
2. Small Wins keep 25 people tweeting about JACPOT every day
3. Drought Bonuses inject funds → Pot grows faster than expected
4. Community sees pot growing despite low volume → "The protocol is healthy!"
5. Growing pot attracts attention → New users arrive
6. Volume recovers → Mega Draw → Viral moment
7. Cycle resets with more users than before

> Drought Bonuses are the **bridge** that carries the protocol through slow periods until organic growth returns. Combined with Daily Small Wins, the protocol never goes silent.
