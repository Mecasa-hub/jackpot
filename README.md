> **Stake. Engage. Win.**

**JACPOT** is a next-generation decentralized protocol that combines **gamified tokenomics**, a **provably fair jackpot system**, and a revolutionary **Luck Staking** engine to create the most engaging DeFi experience ever built.

Unlike traditional yield farming or reflection tokens, JACPOT rewards **consistent engagement** — not passive holding. The longer you stake, the more you engage, and the higher your **Luck Score** grows — directly multiplying your odds of winning the ever-growing jackpot.

## 💡 The Core Philosophy

**"Don't pay people to hold. Reward people for engaging."**

Most DeFi protocols suffer from the same problem: they emit tokens to attract users, creating inflation that eventually kills the project. JACPOT takes a fundamentally different approach:

* **No token emissions** — Staking doesn't mint new tokens
* **No inflationary rewards** — You earn Luck (probability), not money
* **Real revenue** — Jackpots are funded by trading tax; staker rewards and operations are funded by ticket sales and treasury yield
* **Engagement > Holding** — Active participants have exponentially better odds than passive holders
* **Daily winners** — 25 people win prizes every single day and share on X to claim
