# Hype Vault

## What Is the Hype Vault?

The Hype Vault is a **dedicated marketing and growth fund** that operates on a simple principle:

> **When times are good, save. When times are slow, spend.**

It's funded by 25% of treasury yield and deploys automatically during low-volume periods to drive awareness, attract new users, and reignite trading activity.

## How It Works

### Accumulation Phase (Normal/High Volume)

When trading volume is **above the baseline threshold**:
- 25% of treasury yield flows into the Hype Vault
- The vault balance grows
- No marketing spend is triggered
- The vault is visible on the dashboard — community can see it building

### Deployment Phase (Low Volume)

When trading volume drops **below the baseline threshold for 3+ consecutive days**:
- The Hype Vault activates
- A **daily marketing budget** is released (percentage of vault balance)
- Funds are used for pre-approved marketing activities
- Deployment continues until volume recovers or vault reaches minimum reserve

### Deployment Schedule

| Vault Balance | Daily Deployment Rate | Daily Budget Example ($100K vault) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Above $50K | 2% per day | $2,000/day |
| $20K - $50K | 1.5% per day | $750/day |
| $10K - $20K | 1% per day | $150/day |
| Below $10K | Paused (minimum reserve) | $0 |

## What the Hype Vault Funds

| Activity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Influencer Campaigns** | Paid promotions with crypto influencers |
| **Twitter/X Raids** | Coordinated community engagement campaigns |
| **Meme Contests** | Community-created content with USDC prizes |
| **Partnership Announcements** | Co-marketing with partner protocols |
| **Airdrop Campaigns** | Targeted raffle pass airdrops to new communities |
| **Content Creation** | Articles, videos, infographics about JACPOT |
| **Event Sponsorships** | Presence at crypto conferences and Twitter Spaces |

## Governance

### Who Decides How Funds Are Spent?

- **Diamond+ tier stakers** vote on marketing strategy priorities
- The team proposes a **monthly marketing plan**
- Community votes to approve or modify
- Execution is handled by the team with transparent reporting

### Transparency

- All Hype Vault transactions are on-chain
- Monthly marketing reports detail spend and results
- ROI metrics tracked: new wallets, volume change, social growth

## Why This Matters

Most crypto projects have two modes:
1. **Bull market** — Everything is great, no marketing needed
2. **Bear market** — No money for marketing, project dies

JACPOT has a **third mode**: The Hype Vault ensures marketing spend is **counter-cyclical** — it deploys when it's needed most, funded by savings from when it wasn't.

> The Hype Vault is the protocol's **immune system** — it activates precisely when the ecosystem is under stress.
