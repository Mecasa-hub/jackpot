# Hype Vault

## What Is the Hype Vault?

The Hype Vault is a **dedicated marketing and growth fund** that operates on a simple principle:

> **When times are good, save. When times are slow, spend.**

It's funded by 25% of Treasury DeFi yield and deploys automatically during low-volume periods to drive awareness, attract new users, and reignite trading activity.

## How It Works

### Accumulation Phase (Normal/High Volume)

When trading volume is **above the baseline threshold**:
- 25% of Treasury DeFi yield flows into the Hype Vault
- The vault balance grows passively
- No marketing spend is triggered
- The vault balance is visible on the dashboard — community can see it building

### Deployment Phase (Low Volume)

When trading volume drops **below the baseline threshold for 3+ consecutive days**:
- The Hype Vault activates alongside [Pressure Mode](../sustainability/pressure-mode.md)
- A **daily marketing budget** is released (percentage of vault balance)
- Funds are used for pre-approved marketing activities
- Deployment continues until volume recovers or vault reaches minimum reserve

### Deployment Schedule

| Vault Balance | Daily Deployment Rate | Daily Budget Example ($100K vault) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Above $50K | 2% per day | $2,000/day |
| $20K – $50K | 1.5% per day | $750/day |
| $10K – $20K | 1% per day | $150/day |
| Below $10K | Paused (minimum reserve) | $0 |

## Funding Source

The Hype Vault is funded exclusively by **Treasury DeFi yield**, not by trading taxes or ticket sales:

```
Ticket Sales → Treasury
    │
    └── 75% deployed to DeFi protocols (5-15% APY)
            │
            └── Yield generated
                    │
                    ├── 25% → Hype Vault
                    ├── 20% → Drought Bonuses
                    ├── 40% → Mystery Crates & Rewards
                    ├── 10% → Operations
                    └── 5% → Reserve Buffer
```

## What the Hype Vault Funds

| Activity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Influencer Campaigns** | Paid promotions with crypto influencers |
| **Twitter/X Raids** | Coordinated community engagement campaigns |
| **Meme Contests** | Community-created content with USDC prizes |
| **Partnership Announcements** | Co-marketing with partner protocols |
| **Airdrop Campaigns** | Targeted ticket airdrops to new communities |
| **Content Creation** | Articles, videos, infographics about VORTEX |
| **Event Sponsorships** | Presence at crypto conferences and Twitter Spaces |
| **Winner Amplification** | Boosting Daily Small Win and Vortex winner posts on X |

## Synergy with the Two-Tier Draw System

The Hype Vault amplifies the protocol's built-in viral mechanics:

### During Normal Operations
- **25 Daily Small Win winners** share on X to claim prizes → organic visibility
- **Vortex winners** create viral moments → organic growth
- Hype Vault **saves** — no spend needed when organic marketing is working

### During Low Volume / Pressure Mode
- Small Win winners still tweet daily → baseline visibility maintained
- Hype Vault **deploys** → paid amplification of winner stories
- Drought Bonuses grow the pot → "Mega pot at $XXK!" campaigns
- Combined effect: organic tweets + paid promotion = maximum reach

## Governance

### Who Decides How Funds Are Spent?

- **Diamond+ tier stakers** vote on marketing strategy priorities
- The team proposes a **monthly marketing plan**
- Community votes to approve or modify
- Execution is handled by the team with transparent reporting

### Transparency

- All Hype Vault transactions are on-chain
- Monthly marketing reports detail spend and results
- ROI metrics tracked: new wallets, volume change, social growth
- Vault balance visible on the dApp dashboard at all times

## Why This Matters

Most crypto projects have two modes:
1. **Bull market** — Everything is great, no marketing needed
2. **Bear market** — No money for marketing, project dies

VORTEX has a **third mode**: The Hype Vault ensures marketing spend is **counter-cyclical** — it deploys when it's needed most, funded by savings from when it wasn't.

Combined with the Daily Small Wins system (which generates 25 organic tweets per day regardless of volume), the protocol **never goes silent** — even during the worst market conditions.

> The Hype Vault is the protocol's **immune system** — it activates precisely when the ecosystem is under stress, amplifying the organic visibility that Small Win winners already provide.
