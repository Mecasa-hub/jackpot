# Token Overview

## Token Utility

The JACPOT token is **not** a passive investment vehicle. It is the **key** to the entire JACPOT ecosystem. Here's what it unlocks:

### 1. Luck Staking
Stake JACPOT to accumulate **Luck** — the non-transferable score that multiplies your raffle odds. More tokens staked = faster Luck accumulation.

### 2. Mystery Crate Access
Only JACPOT stakers can claim daily Mystery Crates. No stake = no crate.

### 3. Tier Unlocks
Your Luck Score (driven by staking) unlocks tiers from Bronze to Legendary, each with escalating benefits including exclusive draws, better crate drop rates, and higher odds multipliers.

### 4. Mission Eligibility
Daily Missions require holding or staking JACPOT. You can't earn Luck Shards without skin in the game.

### 5. Governance (Diamond+ Tier)
High-tier stakers gain voting rights on treasury deployment, seasonal event parameters, and protocol upgrades.

## Why Hold JACPOT?

| Reason | Mechanism |
| --- | --- |
| **Better odds** | Staking = Luck = higher win probability |
| **Daily rewards** | Mystery Crates and missions (stakers only) |
| **Compounding advantage** | Longer stake = exponentially more Luck |
| **Unstake penalty** | Luck Decay makes selling costly in terms of accumulated advantage |
| **Exclusive access** | Higher tiers unlock exclusive draws and features |
| **Buyback pressure** | 10% of raffle pass sales buy back JACPOT from the market |

## Tax Breakdown

Every buy and sell of JACPOT incurs a **5% tax**, collected entirely in **USDC**:

The tax is simple and transparent. Every cent goes to the jackpot. No hidden allocations, no team cuts from tax.
