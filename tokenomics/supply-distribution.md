# Supply Distribution

## Total Supply: 1,000,000,000 VORTEX

The total supply is **fixed at 1 billion tokens**. No minting function exists — the supply can only decrease through natural market dynamics and locked staking.

## Allocation Breakdown

| Allocation | Percentage | Tokens | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 🌊 **Liquidity Pool** | 40% | 400,000,000 | Initial DEX liquidity on Base |
| 🍀 **Staking Rewards Pool** | 20% | 200,000,000 | Reserved for Luck Staking incentives |
| 👥 **Team & Development** | 15% | 150,000,000 | Core team allocation (vested) |
| 📣 **Marketing & Partnerships** | 10% | 100,000,000 | Growth campaigns, influencers, partnerships |
| 🎁 **Community & Airdrops** | 10% | 100,000,000 | Community rewards, airdrops, events |
| 🔒 **Reserve** | 5% | 50,000,000 | Emergency reserve, future development |

## Vesting Schedule

### Team & Development (15%)
- **6-month cliff** — No tokens accessible for the first 6 months
- **24-month linear vesting** — Tokens unlock gradually over 2 years after the cliff
- **Purpose:** Ensures long-term team commitment and prevents early dumping

### Marketing & Partnerships (10%)
- **No cliff** — Available from launch for immediate marketing needs
- **Controlled release** — Managed by multi-sig wallet with community oversight
- **Purpose:** Funds launch campaigns, influencer partnerships, and exchange listings

### Community & Airdrops (10%)
- **Event-driven release** — Distributed through seasonal events, community quests, and engagement campaigns
- **Purpose:** Rewards early adopters and drives organic community growth

## Liquidity Strategy

### Initial Liquidity (40%)
- Paired with USDC on Base DEX at launch
- Liquidity tokens **locked for 12 months minimum**
- Lock verified on-chain and publicly auditable

### Liquidity Protection
- 5/5% buy/sell tax (4% vortex / 1% team) discourages rapid trading and bot activity
- 50% Luck penalty on unstaking discourages panic selling
- Tier system rewards long-term holding with compounding advantages

## Circulating Supply Dynamics

Over time, the effective circulating supply decreases due to:

| Factor | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| **Luck Staking** | Tokens locked in staking contracts, removed from circulation |
| **Team Vesting** | 15% locked for up to 30 months |
| **Liquidity Lock** | 40% locked in DEX liquidity |
| **Reserve Lock** | 5% held in multi-sig reserve |
| **Natural Holding** | Luck penalty discourages selling |

### Projected Circulating Supply

| Timeframe | Est. Circulating Supply | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Launch | ~30% (300M) | Only community, airdrop, and partial marketing tokens circulate |
| Month 6 | ~35% (350M) | Team cliff ends, small unlock begins |
| Month 12 | ~40% (400M) | Gradual team vesting + marketing spend |
| Month 24+ | ~50% (500M) | Full team vesting complete; staking locks offset unlocks |

> **Note:** These projections assume moderate staking participation (~40% of circulating supply staked). Higher staking rates would further reduce effective circulating supply.

## Anti-Whale Measures

- **Per-wallet purchase caps** on raffle tickets prevent whale domination of draws
- **Tier system** ensures small holders have dedicated draw pools
- **Luck Score** rewards consistency over size — a long-term small staker can outperform a short-term whale
