# Micro-Loot System

## Overview

The **Micro-Loot System** is JACPOT's daily engagement layer — a gamified set of mechanics designed to keep users returning every day, even between major jackpot draws. It consists of three interconnected components:

1. **Daily Missions** — Simple tasks that reward Luck Shards
2. **Mystery Crates** — Daily claimable loot boxes with tiered rewards
3. **Luck Shards** — Bonus points that boost your Luck Score

> **Design Philosophy:** The Micro-Loot System ensures that every day in the JACPOT ecosystem feels rewarding, regardless of whether you win the jackpot.

## Daily Missions

### What Are Daily Missions?

Daily Missions are simple on-chain tasks that reset every 24 hours. Completing them earns **Luck Shards** and maintains your **engagement streak**.

### Available Missions

| Mission | Task | Reward |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🎁 **Crate Collector** | Claim your daily Mystery Crate | 10 Luck Shards |
| 📊 **Leaderboard Check** | View the community leaderboard | 5 Luck Shards |
| 🔥 **Streak Keeper** | Log in on consecutive days | 5–50 Luck Shards (scales with streak) |
| 🎟️ **Ticket Buyer** | Purchase at least 1 raffle ticket | 15 Luck Shards |
| 🍀 **Luck Checker** | Check your current Luck Score | 5 Luck Shards |

### Streak System

Consecutive daily engagement is rewarded with escalating bonuses:

| Streak Length | Daily Bonus | Cumulative Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1–7 days | 1.0x base | Building foundation |
| 8–14 days | 1.25x Luck Shard earnings | Noticeable boost |
| 15–30 days | 1.5x Luck Shard earnings | Significant advantage |
| 31–60 days | 2.0x Luck Shard earnings | Major competitive edge |
| 61–90 days | 2.5x Luck Shard earnings | Elite status |
| 90+ days | 3.0x Luck Shard earnings | Maximum streak bonus |

> ⚠️ **Missing a single day resets your streak to 0.** This creates a powerful daily habit loop.

## Mystery Crates

### What Are Mystery Crates?

Mystery Crates are **daily claimable rewards** available to all JACPOT stakers. Each crate contains a randomized reward based on a tiered rarity system.

### Rarity Tiers

| Rarity | Drop Rate | Possible Contents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ⬜ **Common** | 60% | 5–20 Luck Shards |
| 🟦 **Uncommon** | 25% | 25–75 Luck Shards |
| 🟪 **Rare** | 10% | 100–250 Luck Shards, small USDC micro-reward |
| 🟨 **Epic** | 4% | 500+ Luck Shards, USDC micro-reward, bonus ticket entry |
| 🟧 **Legendary** | 1% | 1,000+ Luck Shards, significant USDC reward, guaranteed jackpot entry |

### Crate Mechanics

- **One crate per day** per wallet (resets at 00:00 UTC)
- **Must be claimed manually** — unclaimed crates expire after 24 hours
- **Tier affects crate quality** — higher staking tiers receive better base odds
- **Streak bonus** — longer streaks increase the probability of higher-rarity crates

### Tier-Based Crate Bonuses

| Tier | Rare+ Chance | Epic+ Chance | Legendary Chance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 🥉 Bronze | 15% | 5% | 1% |
| 🥈 Silver | 20% | 7% | 1.5% |
| 🥇 Gold | 25% | 10% | 2% |
| 💎 Diamond | 30% | 12% | 3% |
| 👑 Legendary | 35% | 15% | 5% |

## Luck Shards

### What Are Luck Shards?

Luck Shards are **non-transferable bonus points** that enhance your Luck Score. They are earned exclusively through daily engagement — missions, crates, and special events.

### How Shards Boost Your Luck

Luck Shards operate through a **hybrid utility model**:

#### 1. Multiplicative Boost
Shards provide a percentage bonus on top of your base Luck Score:

```
Effective Luck = Base Luck × (1 + Shard Multiplier)
```

| Shards Accumulated | Multiplier Bonus |
| --- | --- |
| 0–100 | +0% |
| 101–500 | +2% |
| 501–2,000 | +5% |
| 2,001–10,000 | +10% |
| 10,001–50,000 | +15% |
| 50,001+ | +20% (max) |

#### 2. Spendable Currency
Shards can also be **spent** on ecosystem perks:

| Item | Cost | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🎟️ **Bonus Ticket Entry** | 500 Shards | 1 additional raffle entry for the day |
| ⚡ **Luck Boost (24h)** | 1,000 Shards | 1.5x Luck Score for 24 hours |
| 🎁 **Premium Crate** | 2,500 Shards | Guaranteed Rare+ crate |
| 🔥 **Streak Shield** | 5,000 Shards | Protects your streak for 1 missed day |

> **Strategic Choice:** Players must decide whether to accumulate shards for the passive multiplier or spend them for immediate tactical advantages.

---

## Engagement Loop

The Micro-Loot System creates a self-reinforcing daily habit:

```
Log In → Complete Missions → Earn Shards → Claim Crate → Boost Luck → Better Odds → Win → Share on X → Return Tomorrow
```

### Why This Works

| Mechanic | Psychological Driver |
| --- | --- |
| Daily Missions | **Routine formation** — simple tasks create habits |
| Mystery Crates | **Variable reward** — unpredictable rewards are more engaging than fixed ones |
| Streak System | **Loss aversion** — fear of losing streak progress drives daily returns |
| Luck Shards | **Progress tracking** — visible accumulation creates sense of advancement |
| Tier Progression | **Status seeking** — public leaderboard creates social motivation |
| 25 Daily Winners | **Proximity to winning** — seeing others win daily makes it feel achievable |
